## Problem :x:
I have two Github accounts: *user1* (personal) and *user2* (for work).
I want to use both accounts on same computer (without typing password everytime, when doing git push or pull).

## Solution :white_check_mark:
Use ssh keys and define host aliases in ssh config file (each alias for an account). AND use diffrent .gitconfig user credentials depending on what directory you're currently working in. 

## How? ðŸŒŸ
